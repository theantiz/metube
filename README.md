# MeTube – Full Stack YouTube Video Downloader  

A full-stack application built with **React + Tailwind CSS** and **Spring Boot** that allows users to **download and stream YouTube videos** in the highest available quality.  
It uses [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and `ffmpeg` under the hood to ensure reliable and high-quality downloads.

✅ Simple and responsive UI built with **React + Tailwind CSS**  
✅ Auto-merges video and audio using `ffmpeg`  
✅ Streams the `.mp4` file directly to the client  
✅ Cleans up temporary files after response

✅ Fully compatible with **Ubuntu + JDK 23 (Valhalla EA)**

## 🧠 How It Works  

When a user pastes a YouTube link and clicks **Download**:

1. The **React frontend** sends a request to the backend endpoint:  
   `/api/download?url=<YouTube_URL>`  
2. The **Spring Boot backend** runs a `yt-dlp` command that downloads the best-quality video and audio streams.  
3. `ffmpeg` merges both streams into a single `.mp4` file.  
4. The merged video is **streamed directly** to the browser.  
5. The backend **deletes temporary files** automatically after completion.
